   - Safe and direct communication with Apple servers over SRP-6a / GSA protocol.

2. **App Store Search & Discovery:**
   - Search by app name or paste an App Store URL.
   - Filter by iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV.
   - View app icons, prices, versions, and bundle IDs.
   - 1-click Download, 1-click License acquisition, and Version history.

3. **Direct Download:**
   - Download by Bundle Identifier or numeric App ID.
   - Optional version ID targeting.
   - Automatic free license acquisition (`--purchase`).

6. **Session Portability:**
   - Export session token to `account-session.json` to reuse without passwords or 2FA codes.
   - Import session token on any device.

7. **Install `.IPA` on a connected iOS device:**
   - Automatically detects connected iPhone/iPad devices with `libimobiledevice`.
   - Upload (or reuse) a downloaded `.IPA` and install it with `ideviceinstaller`.
   - Requires `ideviceinstaller` (macOS: `brew install libimobiledevice`, Windows: install a libimobiledevice / iDevice Suite build and put its `bin` on PATH, or extract the build and copy its `.exe`/`.dll` files into the `tools\` folder next to `ipatool.exe` — the GUI detects them automatically). You can also set `IPATOOL_IDEVICEINSTALLER`, `IPATOOL_IDEVICE_ID` and `IPATOOL_IDEVICEDEVICEINFO` to the exact paths.

## 🔑 Interactive login on Windows

Interactive App Store login (password + 2FA) **does work on Windows** through the
**legacy flow**: it posts to the older `MZFinance.woa/wa/authenticate` endpoint and
signs the request with an **SAP action signature** produced by the `sapsigner.exe`
helper that ships with this tool (the macOS-style CommerceKit service is not
available on Windows). The GSA (SRP-6a) flow — which needs iCloud anisette data — is
consistently rejected by Apple on Windows with a machine-provisioning error
`-22410`, so it is not attempted there.

**Prerequisites for Windows login:**
1. Keep the `sapsigner.exe` binary (and its companion files) that ships with this
   build in the `tools\` folder next to `ipatool.exe` — it is auto-detected. To
   override the location, set the environment variable `IPATOOL_SAPSIGNER` to the
   full path of `sapsigner.exe`.

2. Restart the GUI and try logging in again — you will be prompted for your password
   and 2FA code.

If login fails because `sapsigner.exe` was not found, make sure the `tools\` bundle is
in place next to `ipatool.exe` or set `IPATOOL_SAPSIGNER`. (Anisette/iCloud errors are
no longer expected on Windows, since the GSA path is not used.) As a fallback, you can
import a session created on a Mac:

1. **Log in once on a Mac** (Terminal): `ipatool auth login --email "you@example.com"` (enter your 2FA code if asked).
2. **Export the session:** `ipatool auth export --output account-session.json` (no password is stored in the file, only App Store tokens).
3. **Copy `account-session.json`** to the Windows PC and **import** it via **"Import Session File"** on the **"Account"** tab.

After importing, search, license acquisition, and `.IPA` downloads all work on Windows
**without a password or 2FA code**.

## 📲 Installing Downloaded `.IPA` files on iOS

- **Built-in "Install to device" tab (fastest):** open the **Install to device** tab, click Refresh, choose the connected device, pick a downloaded `.ipa`, and press **Install on device**. This uses `ideviceinstaller` from `libimobiledevice`; if it is missing, install it as described in the feature list above.
- **Sideloadly (Recommended for Windows):** Drag & drop the `.ipa` into Sideloadly, connect iPhone via USB, click Start.
- **AltStore:** Sideload wirelessly over local Wi-Fi.
- **TrollStore:** Permanent install for supported iOS versions without 7-day expiration.
